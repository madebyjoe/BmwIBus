# BMW IBus System

This was code that was designed to run on a tablet connected to a BMW through a serial adapter to the IBUS. Pretty much everything having to do with the multimedia of the vehicle can be controlled through the IBUS. Right now, only the media track forward and track backward have been mapped to the steering wheel. In the future, pretty much everything can be mapped.

New mappings do require reverse engineering the ibus though.
